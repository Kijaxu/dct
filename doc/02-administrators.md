# Administrators

Administration is relatively straight forward. This section will walk
you through installation and configuration.

## Installation

DCT is distributed as a standard DCS module. You can download the
[latest release](https://github.com/jtoppins/dct/releases/latest)
and download the zip file.

Once downloaded copy the `DCT` folder contained in the zip file to your
DCS saved games directory and place in;

	<dcs-saved-games>/Mods/tech

If the path does not exist just create it.

## Configuration
