Flights Possible (available resources):
 F_possible = sum[i = 1,S](current_i / flightsize_i)
   where 'S' is the number of squadrons on a side

flight utilization:
 F_allowed = F_possible * clamp(P_opposing/P_opposingmax,
	U_min, U_max)
 U_min - utilization min percentage of F_possible
 U_max - utilization max percentage of F_possible

Expected AI flights:
 F_expected = F_allowed - P_current


how to handle mission selection and planning?
A: possibly through utility and planning

Mission Types:
 M_p = Union(S_i.ato)
   The union of all possible missions all squadrons can fly

world state for mission selection:
 * friendly fighter strength - raw number of flights assigned to CAP/ALERT +
      players
 * enemy fighter strength
 * friendly sam strength - average sam strength over all regions
      sum[i=1,R](SAM_r)/R - more or less represents coverage
 * enemy sam strength
 * friendly infrastructure strength
 * enemy infrastructure strength
 * friendly sea strength
 * enemy sea strength
 * friendly supply
 * enemy supply
 * friendly pilot rescue needed
 * friendly ewr strength
 * enemy ewr strength
 * friendly land tactical strength
 * enemy land tactical strength

Mission Types:
CAS   - decreases enemy ground tactical strength
CAP   - increases friendly fighter strength
ALERT - increases friendly fighter strength, has a higher cost
        because the a/c are on the ground
STRIKE- decreases enemy infrastructure
SEAD  - decreases enemy sam strength
BAI   - decreases enemy supply
OCA   - decreases enemy fighter strength
TRANSPORT - increases friendly supply
ROUTERECON - as requested??
CSAR  - ??
