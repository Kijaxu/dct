Enemy AI will be grouped into 'squadrons' with some squadrons existing on-map
and some off-map.


Squadrons will have the following attributes:
	* home airbase or spawn location if no airbase
	* squadron size or unlimited
	* moral
	* type of aircraft flown, each squadron flies only a single airframe
	* payload definition
	* destroyed state description; if any of the states become true
		the squadron becomes destroyed.
