== Asset Death
Currently an Asset only supports a 'deathgoal'
this is O.K. for now but eventually we need to be able
to specify 'success' goals for each side/coalition. This
allows for something like a CAS mission to be defined
where the objective (success goals) could be to prevent
the destruction of the JTAC and cause 80% damage to the
units in the area. This concept could probably be
contained in a 'mission' instead of an objective.
This is actually not the correct way to do this,
instead these goals should be defined in a 'mission'
object and assets should only be concerned with
when and how they are defined to be dead and concerned
with in-game object life-cycles. 'Missions' can be
concerned with if a particular asset is dead determines
failure or not.
