### Goal

general types of goals:
* relaxed
** patrol, rtb, refuel
* investigative
** search, intercept
* aggressive
** chase, Attack, AttackWithSAMCover, AttackWithSupport, flee

#### API:
* priority
* isValid()
**  motives influence validity; example moral would dictate if an air
    defense system would turn on its radar
** situational requirements
* desired world state
* behavior graph for selecting goals


### Action

GoToPoint, GoToSAMCover, Attack, Orbit, Patrol, Refuel, SetROE


### Aircraft World States

* bingo - an enum {bingo, joker, jokerplus10, jokerplus20}
          the actual value is dynamically calculated based on type of
          aircraft and burnrate, ultimatly results in a true/false
          state
* SAM Cover - the unit is within weapon range of a friendly SAM system
* Friendlies Nearby - other friendly CAP units are nearby
* Winchester - a/c weapon state
* Enemy Detected - an enemy available to attach
* A/C ROE - a/c roe setting; hold, return fire, free


agent("world") states:
* bingo

fsm states:
* perform-action
* idle

actions:
   API:
    * isValid()
    * what world state it satisfies
    * pre-conditions: require more world state
    * cost() - situational cost
    * open-ended actions; continue attacking until bingo


Agent Roles:
* airplane
   * actions: takeoff, land, move to point, orbit, flee, attack
* bomber
   * actions: <all airplane actions>
* fighter
   * actions: <all airplane actions>, intercept, racetrack
* support
   * actions: <all airplane actions>, racetrack
* multirole

* intercept; pre: cap or scramble
* patrol; pre: takeoff
* rtb; pre: low fuel













## Strategic planner

states:

world states:
* enemy detected
* enemy in range
* mission type enum: {CAP {HAVCAP, BARCAP, Ambush CAP, Escort, TARCAP etc},
                      BAI, CAS, DEAD|SEAD, FAC, OCA Strike, Sweep, Strike,
                      Support {tanker, recon, bda, }}



## Flight Planner

Handles a specific group/package/mission execution. A flight planner is given
at a minimum;
  * a goal
  * a group(s)/agents to go for goal
  * a time window to achieve the goal in
  * an roe
