Kinds of things that would normally be in a mission:
* player/client groups
* map defined bases belonging to a side
* mission defined bases(FARPS) belonging to a side
* player support units; tankers, AWACS/EWR, FAC
* air defense (red & blue)
* ground forces
* strike targets
* AI flights


Things that must be in the mission file due to scripting limitations:
* player slots
* Anything that wants to be connected to the DCS resource
  system; FARPS, warehouses
* <not sure of what else??>


This leads to various types of templates.
Types of templates:

* base
	- base templates list defensive units to be spawned based on
	  whom controls the base. Since base occupation state is
	  something that will be tracked in the game state these
	  templates will need to be read in every time.

* facility
	- facilities spawn a set of groups(air, land, and/or sea)
	  belonging to a single side that generally do not move.
	  These types of templates would generally represent
	  strategic targets; factories, ports, ammo dumps, etc.
	  These kinds of templates only need to be used once
	  per game state reset as the individual states of the
	  statics and/or units belonging to the template can be
	  tracked and restored.
	  Also there is the idea that facilities can be "fixed" or
	  "movable", by this we mean a movable template is one that
	  can be placed anywhere on the map and is not intended to
	  only ever spawn in one specific place [Not implemented,
	  may not need?]

* support
	- a support template is one that defines where and what kind of
	  support unit will provide a service to a player; there are
	  3 main sub-types; tanker, ewr/awacs, fac
	  Support templates are special because they will likely need to
	  be respawned.

* mission specific
	-

* generic group
	-

* air defense
	- a template that will spawn some kind of air defense group.
	  The template is special because groups spawned of this type
	  will be given control to a side's air defense AI.


Some other special higher level template types (ideas mainly):

* squadron
	- a kind of template that defines a "squadron". Squadrons are
	  assigned to a side's Airforce Commander (JFACC) to be utilized
	  by the stretigic AI for mission taskings. AI squadrons would
	  be limited in number and belong to a specific airbase.

* battalion ORBAT
	- a kind of template that defines a ground or helo AI battalion
	  ORBAT. These would be assigned to the ground commander AI.


The point of listing these different types of templates is because
this naturally leads into a directory structure for the templates.

For example bases probable need to look something like this:

<template-root>
  + bases
     + <base-name>
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}

An example facility directory structure would be:

<template-root>
  + facilities
     + fixed
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}
     + movable
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}

The benefit of having templates in a directory structure is we only need
to re-read a subset of them if needed. And only need to keep certain sets
in memory after they have spawned their groups.







:22 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: Yeah, no worries, ill do it in some downtime at work today.
[4:26 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: So first of all, we can of course change the filing structure to whatever you would like, this is how I've organised it during creation. Now as far as I am aware we are going to be spawning all blue assets through the .miz, because of player slots etc, so the only folder that matters is the Red Assets and its subfolders.

The FARPs folder contains the two FARPs on the map that should start out as Red but be captured by Blue during the campaign, one at Khasab and one at Greater Tunb. I dont know how to handle FARP capture, so if I need to create a Blue version as well I can, just let me know what I need to do there.

The Primary Targets folder contains all of the templates for the Primary objectives of the campaign, namely 3 EWR sites, 10 Strategic SAM emplacements, and 6 Silkworm sites. It also contains 10 Templates for Airbase defences, as these should be considered primary objectives as part of regaining control of the Strait. I do not imagine them being assignable targets, more as defences that players will inevitably come across and destroy anyway. Essentially, if an STM is in the primary targets folder, it should be spawned on every single state 'reset,' but not 'reload,' obviously. (I think ive used the agreed on terms there, ha) From a gameplay point of view, every single one of these targets must be destroyed (except the airbase defences,) to allow Blue to win P1.

The secondary targets folder gets a little more complicated.
[4:52 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: I view secondary targets as targets that are non-critical to mission completion. From a gameplay perspective, I would define P1 success as "All primary objectives completed, AND 70% Secondary objectives completed." This gives plenty of stuff for players to do, and everything players do is meaningful to the campaign progression.

Within the Secondary Targets folder, targets are in folders according to their type;
Ammo Dump
Fuel Dump
Factory
C2 etc.

Every single static target STM in these folders is unique and will not conflict with another static target STM, with only a few exceptions, which ill explain in a moment.

This means that for the Ammo Dumps, Bunkers Depots Warehouses, C2, Factories, Fuel Dumps, and Road Checkpoints folders, you can spawn as many as you'd like and they will not conflict. Id spawn maybe 30-40% of each folder, depending on how many there are total. For example, there are 12 fuel dumps, so I'd spawn 4-5, maybe 6 per rotation. However, there are only 5 factories, so spawn only 2, maybe 3.
[5:01 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: For the remaining folders, namely OCA, Port Strikes, and Shipping Strikes, there is a chance that spawns could conflict. As such, each of these folders has sub-folders that contain the ones that could possibly conflict. For example, 
"\Secondary Targets\OCA\Khasab" has five POSSIBLE targets within it, but you can only spawn ONE at a time, or the targets will overlap. The same applies for the other two folders, but I need to double check the Shipping Strikes folder for overlapping routes, which I'll do tonight. 

As such, you can spawn as many of those targets as you'd like, but a MAXIMUM of one per Sub-Directory.

Lastly, the convoys folder. The spawning of these is going to be handled totally differently.
[5:38 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: Convoys are going to be spawned only when requested as a mission, and on a timer. For example -
Player requests Convoy mission - is assigned a convoy target - script calculates estimated time from player's location to convoy location (45 minutes) - after 45 minutes the convoy is spawned and moves to destination.

As such, there shouldnt really be any overlaps as convoys are very unlikely to spawn in the same place at the same time, but if this issue does arise then i can check and change the routes. Right now i dont think its a problem.
[5:43 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: So, TLDR;
PRIMARY TARGETS
Always spawn on every server reset.

SECONDARY TARGETS
Ammo Dumps, Bunkers Depots Warehouses, C2, Factories, Fuel Dumps, and Road Checkpoints
     - Spawn X from each folder per reset.

OCA, Port Strikes, Shipping Strikes
   - Spawn ONE from X sub-folders per reset.

Convoys
  - Spawn ONE from the list on demand from players getting assigned target.
[6:45 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: @instigator Apologies for what turned into a rather long description, but I wanted to make sure I was as clear as possible on everything. I don't know the best way to organise this stuff for your purposes, so if you need changes made or things moved or any questions let me know.
[6:51 AM] VMFA-169 | Kijaxu: Currently my plan to spawn around 40% of each folder gives us 40 Secondary targets on the map, plus the 20 ish primaries, plus CAP, plus Convoys. Plenty of stuff to do.
