Kinds of things that would normally be in a mission:
* player/client groups
* map defined bases belonging to a side
* mission defined bases(FARPS) belonging to a side
* player support units; tankers, AWACS/EWR, FAC
* air defense (red & blue)
* ground forces
* strike targets
* AI flights


Things that must be in the mission file due to scripting limitations:
* player slots
* Anything that wants to be connected to the DCS resource
  system; FARPS, warehouses
* <not sure of what else??>


This leads to various types of templates.
Types of templates:

* base
	- base templates list defensive units to be spawned based on
	  whom controls the base. Since base occupation state is
	  something that will be tracked in the game state these
	  templates will need to be read in every time.

* facility
	- facilities spawn a set of groups(air, land, and/or sea)
	  belonging to a single side that generally do not move.
	  These types of templates would generally represent
	  strategic targets; factories, ports, ammo dumps, etc.
	  These kinds of templates only need to be used once
	  per game state reset as the individual states of the
	  statics and/or units belonging to the template can be
	  tracked and restored.
	  Also there is the idea that facilities can be "fixed" or
	  "movable", by this we mean a movable template is one that
	  can be placed anywhere on the map and is not intended to
	  only ever spawn in one specific place [Not implemented,
	  may not need?]

* support
	- a support template is one that defines where and what kind of
	  support unit will provide a service to a player; there are
	  3 main sub-types; tanker, ewr/awacs, fac
	  Support templates are special because they will likely need to
	  be respawned.

* mission specific
	-

* generic group
	-

* air defense
	- a template that will spawn some kind of air defense group.
	  The template is special because groups spawned of this type
	  will be given control to a side's air defense AI.


Some other special higher level template types (ideas mainly):

* squadron
	- a kind of template that defines a "squadron". Squadrons are
	  assigned to a side's Airforce Commander (JFACC) to be utilized
	  by the stretigic AI for mission taskings. AI squadrons would
	  be limited in number and belong to a specific airbase.

* battalion ORBAT
	- a kind of template that defines a ground or helo AI battalion
	  ORBAT. These would be assigned to the ground commander AI.


The point of listing these different types of templates is because
this naturally leads into a directory structure for the templates.

For example bases probable need to look something like this:

<template-root>
  + bases
     + <base-name>
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}

An example facility directory structure would be:

<template-root>
  + facilities
     + fixed
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}
     + movable
        <tmpl-name>.{stm,dct}

The benefit of having templates in a directory structure is we only need
to re-read a subset of them if needed. And only need to keep certain sets
in memory after they have spawned their groups.
