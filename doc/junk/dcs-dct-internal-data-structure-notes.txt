how to handle airbases, base defense templates, and squadrons?

how current things work:
  region
     - templates

  region:generate(assetmgr)
     assetmgr:add(asset)



How are we going to manage things?
* have commanders assign targets by region, once N missions are assigned to a region
   select and start assigning to another region
* seperate template/region reading on disk from game objects
* squadron definitions?
  - <name>.sqn
    - defines a/c type
    - number of a/c available
    - pilots available and the mean and sigma of pilot skill
    - loadouts and the type of mission the loadout can service, this defines
        what missions the squadron can fly
* [air]base definitions
  - define an airbase template that contains the initial side the airbase belongs to
  - base templates do not need an stm file
* [air]base defenses
  - chain base defense templates to base assets

Treat airbases, base defenses, and squadrons as assets, associate base defenses with
a given base asset and provide an interface to spawn defenses independant of spawning
the actual base asset.

theater
  - regionlist
     - region
        - templates
        - generate()

assetmgr
  - assetset
  - assetsbyside

cmdr
  - targetregion
  - activemissionlist
