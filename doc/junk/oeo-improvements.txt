Priority Sort Order

sorting order used to sort targets

critera to consider:
- distance to target - not sure distance should matter
- priority of target


Q: How should selection work?
A: Selection of a target should be based on the "priority" of that target and its
   relative threat level compared to the


(regionprio + (-10*ismissionassigned) + assigned)*65536 + tgtprio











1) COMMS PLAN - simplify comms plan


3) CAP - it is obvious to us now that CAP infrastructure is going to be extremely important to keep you guys in the loop. We will ensure that the infrastructure is in place for the next test.

4) SA - We will be making the F10 Map show all blue units. The Your A/C Only is just too restricting with the scope of the mission.


5) COORDINATION - We will be implementing a number of channels for you to group up and organise your packages. OEO is designed for two players to fly together and prosecute a target, and we want to facilitate this as much as possible.

6) BRIEFINGS - provide more descriptive mission briefings, include a known reference point
   like a city and descriptions of building shapes

7) IMPROVE F10 MENU - improve description on how to use the F10 menu and display the
   mission briefing straight out

8) MIZ FILE CHANGES
   * change F5-E weapons to AIM-9P5
   * set labels dot-only
   * change player slots to include updated comms plan
   * keep the F10 maps to only show the player unit



Raw statements from 18JAN2020 "mass test":


7:07 PM]MechSauce:why is this givin me some bms vibes :heart_eyes:
7:19 PM]MechSauce:is there any way to determine which mission is closest to us without setting up the lat long for each mission type, individually
8:11 PM]MechSauce:question, idk if i missheard terrifc but from my memory, he said, if i pick a mission, i'll also have an updated kneeboard with info regarding the mission, like area picture, ground unit targets, etc..
[8:11 PM]MechSauce:but my kneeboard never gotten those info

8:21 PM]instigator:@MechSauce "question, idk if i missheard terrifc but from my memory, he said, if i pick a mission, i'll also have an updated kneeboard with info regarding the mission, like area picture, ground unit targets, etc.." - that was a goal until during some early investigation we found out that the kneeboards are only run during mission start and are not refreshed - it is a ED issue.
[8:21 PM]instigator:it would have to be a mod and I am not even sure if it would be possible with a mod.



[7:19 PM]Kijaxu:No. The Mission assigner gives you a mission and that is your mission, you dont get a choice per se
[7:20 PM]Kijaxu:It does however work on a priority system so you will most likely fly to the nearest mission of your chosen type
[7:20 PM]Kijaxu:It isnt going to assign you something miles behind enemy lines, basically



[8:10 PM]digiebola:trip report: flew from carrier to al dhaf - did some circus shit over the runway a bunch of times, landed, now refueling. Server looks good but there is stutter. Carrier was nice, with just a little refresh pull on the edges of the oculus, but near the ground and on the ground, stutter.
[8:12 PM]digiebola:ATIS is nice
[8:13 PM]digiebola:freq presets would be nice but I wrote them down on my physical kneeboard


8:24 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:Feedback: 
-No lag at all, very smooth the whole time, even on the ground.
-Difficulty level is miles too high for me, if that's what you all like great but not for me.
-The comms plan; CAP west/east? Even with the number of players we had I didn't hear really anything on those channels on SRS at all. You could probably get away with a unified CAP/Strike Freq to make things simpler.
-Kept getting a possible debug thing up saying "Impact point" and then an X/Y coordinate?
-Mission finder was great, and very informative, found my target with ease.
[8:26 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:I'll be honest, it boils down to how shit spotting is in DCS.
[8:26 PM]VMFA-169 Mr.Cheeseface:^
[8:26 PM]Lyndon's Johnson:^
[8:27 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:It's a very touchy subject for many but the lack of red / blue markers like Hoggit is absolute killer for this mission.
[8:27 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:I merged with an F4 at under a mile and couldn't see shit.
[8:28 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:Basically whatever Hoggit has is the perfect balance in my opinion.


[8:29 PM]Waffle:i already love the CSAR stuff and i haven't picked anyone up yet

[8:29 PM]Lyndon's Johnson:Im not getting a response from Shell either. 130.250AM






[8:37 PM]Lyndon's Johnson:nah im throw my hat in the bitch ring
[8:37 PM]Kijaxu:Alright mate, well I appreciate you giving it a shot. This was a little bit of a shit show because we don't have CAP going to the right places, but that will come in the next big update.
[8:37 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:Simplify the comms plan, that'll solve that.
[8:37 PM]Lyndon's Johnson:requested a cap mission btw, said no mission available
[8:39 PM]instigator:yeah not supported just yet



[8:42 PM]Waffle:neat to have, but in no way important - found my CSAR target, but it looked like some grunt with an M4, could it spawn as a pilot skin?
[8:43 PM]instigator:I wish it could, I am not aware of a pilot to spawn as a unit



[8:43 PM]Definitely not Blackbird:hey just as a heads up we had some serious issues with out INS in the tomcat, we were 1Â°10' off on the longditude, that might have been me misstyping the alignment though. We were very lost


[8:51 PM]Arctic Fox:@instigator i7-4770
GTX 970
16GB DDR3


[8:53 PM]SABRE 6-4 | SkyEye:Pros:
-No lag at all
-Mission system was good and worked fine
Cons: 
-The comms plan was kinda buns. Assuming you dedicate one radio to interflight freq, you then have to choose between setting your other radio to CAP East, CAP West, Strike East, Strike West, or AWACS/GCI. Simplifying it to just one CAP freq and one Strike freq would be way better.
-No markers is horrible in DCS because the spotting system is unbelievably trash. Having at least the markers Hoggit has would be way better, at least until ED fixes it.


[8:54 PM]VMFA-169 | Peshka:my specs are as follows CPU ryzen 5 2600, GPU RX-580, 16 GB of ram (DCS is on a SSD)


[8:57 PM]SABRE 6-2 | GorgeFodder:From feedback gathered from most of the Sabre guys tonight, we're in agreement that implementing the Hoggit style markers would make us play again, without them we'd be hesitant. So this sounds like an awesome move on your part.


[8:58 PM]VMFA-169 | Peshka:id like F10 markers for friendlies and external views
[8:59 PM]VMFA-169 | Peshka:it would help for organizing a flight and seeing where people are

[9:00 PM]MechSauce:so i love these strategic objective missions but one con for me, atleast for the jeff.. the mission briefing was to take out a grey storage area.. but on my tgp everything is black n white :joy:


[9:02 PM]Waffle:Feedback - 
CSAR: great to have this mission in place - could use some instructions on how to pick up (i was looking in F10 when he hopped in automatically).  Another neat to have besides a pilot skin on the downed unit would be the pilot popping smoke if a helo gets within range.  Clueless if that's feasible, just shooting for the moon
[9:04 PM]VMFA-169|Terrificfool:one thing that might be interesting: adding some Iranian proxy forces chasing after the pilot
[9:04 PM]VMFA-169|Terrificfool:but.. that might be extremely complex to implement so.... tbd



[9:06 PM]VMFA-169 Mr.Cheeseface:Lil suggestion for the secondary objectives:None instead of nil
[9:06 PM]VMFA-169 Mr.Cheeseface:it's a tad more clear ^^'
[9:06 PM]VMFA-169 Mr.Cheeseface:If there aren't any



9:07 PM]SABRE 0-0 | PsychoKillaMk2:i was having an issue with spotting. but i fought heads down. small markers would be nice

the difficulty was much harder than i was expecting, it was fun but not my cup of tea. 

comms plan was really overcomplicated. i can see the need but only really if you have hundreds of aircraft. 

a blue force tracker, US forces can (i assume) see friendly units, if only approximate markers. this would be a great thing to put onto the F10 maps. unless this is a difficulty setting you want.

i didnt have a chance to use the mission assigner, i just followed my flight lead. i look forward to using that in the future. but i really fucked up that road block. 

cool stuff, would try again... but not at 2am. 

fyi... this was written at 2am, sorry if it doesnt make any sense. 

now for the tacview...



[9:10 PM]SABRE 6-9 | Umkhunto:In both the Tomcat and the Jeffs.
[9:10 PM]SABRE 6-9 | Umkhunto:Radars, not picking up anything at all.
[9:11 PM]SABRE 6-9 | Umkhunto:In the Jeff, I see the DL track. I look on radar, nothing, same for my wingman.



[9:16 PM]MechSauce:overall my first impression, it gives me the feeling like my "sortie matters" which  reminds me of how much i had when i play bms. instead of like in gaw/pgaw were its just a ground quake..  atleast for me ( probably because i've been playing there for about a year now and not much change in the mission )
[9:16 PM]MechSauce:looking forward on the next testing ;D


[9:20 PM]SABRE 0-0 | PsychoKillaMk2:the enemy AI felt good. we were under pressure but we could do our stuff


[9:25 PM]SABRE 6-9 | Umkhunto:What I could see of the AI on DL, looked good. They didn't blindly press and that was awesome. Just a pity that we had some issues with the radars. Not sure whether that was operator error, but It was consistent with more than one person, in more than one airframe. I'm going to look at tacview now to get a better idea.



[9:26 PM]Quaisoir:comms plan is a bit convoluted, I suggest making it simpler
grey minimum labels needed, but ive heard that was planned all along and just got missed this version
very weird radar stuff like Umkhunto said
