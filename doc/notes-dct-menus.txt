commander
 - list of missions indexed by id
 - list of assigned group names <- why this? this is here to answer the
          question if an asset has a mission, however, if the mission id
          is contained in the asset definition then we should not need this.
          We can just verify the the mission id in the asset still maps to
          a real mission and ask the mission if the asset is a member.

== World Representation

=== Strategic Properties (per Region)

* attrition rate           - number of assets lost per period of time, the time period
			     will be defined as the restart period or if we manage it
			     a defined time period if the server never restarts
* logistics                - utility, ability to maintain supply lines
* command and control      - utility, ability to command
* early warning detection  - utility, to detect air/ground threats
* air defense              - utility, ability to defend a region's airspace
* ground defense           - utility, ability to defend a region's ground
* sea defense              - utility, ability to defend a region's costal/port zones

=== Tactical Properties (Flight / Platoon leader)

* target                   - handle, points to the assigned target
* target dead              - bool, true if target is dead
* target detected          - bool, true if target detected
* target in-range          - bool, true if target is in engagement range
* fuel                     - num, value representing percentage of fuel remaining
* hasammo                  - bool, true if ammo available
* atlocation               - bool, at assigned waypoint

==== Tactical Utility

* refuel desire -
* rearm desire  -
* threat level  -

=== Objective State & Death

How without saying every unit/group within an objective is required to be taken out
do we determine the 'death state' of an Objective?

An Objective is just a list of targets (aka Template) and each Template documents
what is "Primary" and what is "Secondary". It also documents if the target must be
"damaged" or "destroyed" and the "damaged" threshold could be defined in the .dct
file.

==== Statics

Statics can be individually called out as a primary or secondary target and
what damage threshold is required.

==== Groups

Groups are more complicated either individual units within the group can be
specified as primary/secondary and at what dmanage level. Or the entire
group can simply be specified as a primary/secondary group and individual
units within that group will be ignored as far as their specific state.

==== Hierarchal State

This grouping plays naturally to a grouping. We have a 'DeathState' for the
overall objective. Then each static and group also has an associate 'DeathState'
which feeds into the overall Objective 'DeathState'. This means that all
sub-DeathStates must be true before the overall objective can be considered dead.

==== Pesudo Code

obj = Objective()
obj:spawn()

within spawn
	* register unit names and associate with this Objective
	* setup a State object that represents the current 'state'
	  of the objective

obj:spawn {
	local state = self.tmpl:spawn()
	self.currstate = state
}

==== State Object

State() {
	isDead()
	addPrimary(name, healthgoal)


unit life states:
  * UNDAMAGED
  * DAMAGED
  * DESTROYED

name = state {
 type = "unit health"
 required = primary | secondary
 current = val
 desired = tgt
}


Unit state types:
* health
* fuel

== Objective Life-cycle

=== 1. Generation

Objectives come in two flavors,
1) via statically defined templates that more or less define 'strategic' targets
   within a theater
2) when certian critera have been met throughout the course of a playthrough, f.e.
   when a human player gets shotdown and the pilot survives (ejects) a pilot
   objective could get generated, ultimatly results in a possible CSAR mission


== Mission Life-cycle

=== 1. Mission Request

==== Requirements

Only allow a user to queue one request at a time.

How should a mission be assigned?
 * Missions are assigned to groups
 * mission termination is one of
	* ABORT:
	    explicitly aborted
	    objective returns to available pool
	* COMPLETE:
	    mission requirements completed, objective moved to
	    completed pool

==== Request Generation

Mission request can be generated in two ways,
1) via a player generated request through the menu UI
2) by some mission critera generating a request for AI players

==== Player Generated Requests

To keep from stalling the game pipeline the UI should generate a
'Mission Request Command' basically a delayed requests so it can be
properly sequenced.

The request should do:
  - validate no outstanding request is pending and no mission already
    assigned
  - mark group as having a pending mission request
  - create 'MissionRequestCommand'
  - if needed register callback with command (callback to be executed
    at the end after the command is executed) 
  - queue up command to request a mission
  - notify player mission request was received

=== 2. Mission Generation and Assignment

  - periodic function notices the Human player request queue has a pending
    request
  - a request is pulled off and executed
  - the MissionRequestCommand is executed
    * priority sort available objectives of the specified type
    * pull highest priority objective and create Mission(objective)
    * remove objective from the available list
    * run HumanGroup:assignMission(mission)
      - verifies group still has no mission assigned and a request pending
      - assign mission to group
      - [?setup tracking tables and register event handlers?] - what do we
        need to setup? All tracking should have been registered when the
        objective was spawned and the Mission class needs to register an
        observer with the objective-completed notification.
      - UI: update group "assigned mission" menu to
        * update menu to contain the generic items
        * apply any mission specific menu items
      - UI: notify player mission has been assigned
      - clear outstanding request flag

=== 3. Mission Execution

Monitor hit and death events to determine when the objective is completed.
The Objective class needs to register individual unit and group names with
the Theater so when hit and death events are triggered it is easy to
know which objective needs to be updated.

On death of each unit remove the associated unit name from the global lookup
table.

=== 4. Mission Retirement

Upon objective completion or abort do:
  * queue Objective complete command
    - remove all remaining group and unit names from lookup tables
    - 


Mission.getBriefing(self)
Mission.getStatus(self)
Mission.abort(self)
Mission.join(self, requestor)
Mission.getAssigned(self)


# Path to Beta

## Missing Items

 - squadrons
 - mission tasking
 - mission joining
 - player mission life-cycle

## Steps to Accomplish

 - [DONE] player slots treated as Asset objects
   * store things like scratchpad, group info, menu info and other things
     sprinkled around the code into this one object
   * generate these Assets from reading the mission table (`env.mission`)
 - mission states
   * implement the newly agreed upon mission life-cycle and player UI changes
   * states: "planning", "active", "complete"
     - to support both AI and players we will need different sets of classes
 - mission tasking
   * allow a mission with different kinds of goals to be defined
   * this tasking is checked by the active mission state to determine
     if the mission's world state is met or no longer possible
     - Example Strike mission:
       * target assigned
       * when target is dead, mission success

     - Example CAS mission:
       * assigned to a jtac to protect, uses the in-game JTAC/AFAC
         functionality
       * failure states (or'ed):
         - target dead
         - mission timeout
       * success states:
         - winchester
       * mission goals:
         - target alive - the target is the JTAC
         - checkin true - lead was within X miles of position and checkin given

      Example On Call CAS mission goals would be:
        * isalive - the flight is alive
        * target alive - in this case the target is the JTAC
        * checkin true - lead was within X miles of position and checkin given
        * on-station for X time - flight doesn't venture beyond Y miles of
          target for X period of time

      Example CAP mission goals would be:
        * isalive - the flight is alive
        * on-station for X time - flight doesn't venture beyond Y miles of
          target for X period of time

 - squadron
   * template definition
   * asset collection
   * airbase interaction
   * commander interaction
 - tactial flyable assets
   * used to represent airplane groups
 - ignore template/asset attribute
   * ignored assets will be excluded from being assigned by AI during mission
     assignment and ignored assets will be excluded from strategic influence,
     ignored assets are not ignored at the tactical level

goal state
1. mission timeout = not expired (false)
2. vul time = expired (true)
3. airspace protection = protected (true)

starting
1. not expired
2. not expired
3. protected

goal
1. false
2. true
3. true

000 - failure
001 - misison continues
010 - f
011 - success
100 - f
101 - f
110 - f
111 - f

"Airspace protection" needs to be a compound state such that it is "protection
for a period of time". This would simplify our test to:

1. mission timeout
2. protect area for time

initial state:
1. false
2. false


Mission States:
 - scheduled
 - idle
 - move to
 - do action

initial state:
 - inair = false
 - mustrtb = false

Example plans for following mission types:
Goal State:
 * inair = true

CAP:
 * additional state:
   - protect airspace
 * plan: takeoff -> protect airspace

CAS:
 * additional state:
   - protect ground area
 * plan: takeoff -> protect ground area

STRIKE|BAI|SEAD|OCA|SEA:
 * additional state:
   - kill target
 * plan: takeoff -> kill asset

SAR|TRANSPORT:
 * state:
   - pickup
   - dropoff
 * plan: takeoff -> pickup -> dropoff

RECON:
 * additional state:
   - recon
   - mustrtb
 * plan: takeoff -> recon -> rtb


AI Plans:

initial state:
 - inair = false
 - mustrtb = true

AEW:
 * additional state:
   - search
 * plan: takeoff -> search -> rtb

AAR:
 * additional state:
   - tank
 * plan: takeoff -> tank -> rtb
