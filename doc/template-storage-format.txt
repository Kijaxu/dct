== Mission Template Directory Format

DCT relies on content that can be built directly in the mission editor, these
individuals need little to no programming stills to provide content to a DCT
enabled mission.

The directory hierarchy is:

    + <Mission Template Directory>
      - theater.goals
      + <Region Directory 1>
        - region.def
        + [bases]
        + [facilities]
        + [missions]
      + <Region Directory N>
        - region.def
        + [bases]
        + [facilities]
        + [missions]
