@FlightControl#6524 as it relates to the "winchester" discussion the answer is
mission specific as to what defines a plane is out of ordnance and needs to
RTB. Also, keep in mind winchester is a plane specific state but the flight
lead (again depending on mission parameters) will determine if the flight is
to RTB or continue until all members of the flight reach winchester. A
possible solution is provide an interface that accepts one table which is a
key value mapping of what weapon types must be expended before the
"winchester" goal is met, once the goal is met it triggers the flight to RTB.
Since this is a goal state for the entire flight there would be a special key
which would allow the author to specify if the entire flight should continue
the attack or RTB upon some number of the flight reaching the state. The issue
will be how to represent the ordnance types, I think DCS could provide some
insight here; https://wiki.hoggitworld.com/view/DCS_enum_weapon_flag
